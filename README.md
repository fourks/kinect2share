# kinect2share
Share skeleton and video data from the Kinect V2 with Isadora. 

Kinect2share is a Windows only OpenFrameworks app based on the example projects included in [Elliot Woods](https://github.com/elliotwoods) fantastic OpenFrameworks plugin, [ofxKinectForWindows2](https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxKinectForWindows2).

The goal of this project is to make as many Kinect2 features available to creative platforms as possible using open standards including OSC (opensoundcontrol), and [Spout](http://spout.zeal.co/).

Specific care has been given to providing demo files for use with the [Isadora creative platform](http://troikatronix.com/).
These demo files provide a basic functional example that Isadora users can build upon.
Currently the [Isadora version 2.5 beta](http://troikatronix.com/isa25beta/) is required to run the demo file.

This project is expected to be in a usable state soon. 
feel free to contact me if you have questions.
